    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup pitted dates (Medjool dates work best)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raw almonds (or any nut of choice)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chia seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cacao powder (optional for a chocolatey flavor)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil (optional for added moisture)</li>
        <li>Pinch of sea salt</li>
        <li>Optional mix-ins: cacao nibs, dried fruit, or additional nuts/seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            In a food processor, add the pitted dates, nuts, shredded coconut, chia seeds, cacao powder (if using), vanilla extract, and a pinch of sea salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blend until the mixture is finely ground and starts to clump together. If the mixture is too dry, add coconut oil to help bind it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the mixture is well combined and sticky, scoop out small portions and roll them into bite-sized balls with your hands.
        </li>
        <li>
            If desired, roll the balls in extra shredded coconut, cacao nibs, or other toppings of your choice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the energy balls on a tray or plate and refrigerate them for at least 20 minutes to firm up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once firm, transfer the energy balls to an airtight container. They can be stored in the fridge for up to two weeks or in the freezer for longer.
