    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>This is an easy and quick recipe that requires little to no effort. It is gluten-free and dairy-free but can be customized to fit your taste. The main ingredients in this recipe are gluten-free rolled oats, coco powder, coconut oil, and maple sugar and coconut sugar. To begin, take a large mixing bowl and combine all your dry ingredients. After that is done, proceed with your melted coconut oil or oil of choice and maple syrup. After mixing well, your mixture should smell almost like brownie batter. You then will take a large flat baking tray and line it with parchment paper. Spread the mixture evenly and flat across the baking tray and set the oven at 320 degrees farenheit. Bake the oats for 10 minutes and then after stiring half way, set for another 10 minutes. After it's done, make sure to let the granola cool completely and store and enjoy within two weeks. Happy granola!</p>
